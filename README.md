# This repository has two main files to the same problem: One compact, one extensive.


# The rest is all example and learning code
#
# The Problem: Write a bash program to calculate the sum and average of integers on each line of a text file.

Each input line will contain a variable number of fields, separated by variable number of spaces. The 1st and 2nd fields will each contain a string with at least one character and no spaces. Zero or more additional fields will each contain either an integer or a non-numeric string.

Each output line should contain all fields of the corresponding input line with two additional fields following: one with the sum of the integers on that line and one with the average of the integers on that line. The average should be rounded to the nearest integer. Output lines should contain spaces matching the longest input line.

# Credit goes to Professor Fogg for this code. The sole purpose of this is a placeholder for the code. Update will arive by summer.
