Cryptography
hash functions
one-way
used for intregity, identification/searching, passwords
MD5 (Message Digest)
SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm)
symmetric key
encrypt and decrypt with same key
efficient, difficult key management
DES, Triple DES (Data Encryption Standard)
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
Blowfish, Twofish
asymetric key
RSA system (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman)
encrypt with recipient's public key, decrypt with private key
sign (hash) with sender's private key, confirm with public key
D-H (Diffie-Hellman) key exchange for forward secrecy
public key infrastructure
identifies holders of public keys
CA (certificate authority) issues and revokes digital certificates with identity, public key
VPN (Virtual Private Network)
PPTP
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol
MS-CHAP (Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol) authenticates
MPPE (Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption) encrypts
convenient, not very secure
L2TP/IPsec
L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol) sets up the tunnel
IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) secures the traffic
IKE (Internet Key Exchange) sets up the security association
ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) authenticates and encrypts
complicated to set up, best for network-to-network links
SSL/TLS
Secure Socket Layer / Transport Layer Security
requires certificates
used for secure web and email as well as VPN
Protection
update OS and applications
patches known holes
use strong authentication
strong, unique passwords
multi-factor
use a firewall
hardware or software
restricts access
limit physical access
secure wireless
use WPA2 (more secure than WAP or WEP), WPA3 coming
eliminate rogue access points
don' use both wired and wireless on same computer
less is more
don't install questionable executables
don't run unnecessary services
use antivirus software
install exactly one product
keep databases up to date
SELinux
security enhanced Linux
OpenBSD
emphasizes correctness and proactive security
